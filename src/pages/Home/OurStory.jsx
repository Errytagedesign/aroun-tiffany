            Aroun and I worked at the same place for a long time without even
            crossing paths. <br /> <br />
            He saw me and attempted to talk to me but as focused as I was that
            day I didnâ€™t even remember meeting or speaking with him.
            <br /> <br />
            Aroun later switched from working day shifts hours to Night shift
            hours working on a floor that I HEAVILY avoided being pulled to. So
            we never really crossed paths.
            <br /> <br />
            I got my first Apartment NOVEMBER 8, 2018. And decided I could use
            extra hours on night shift after paying 1st last and security
            deposit.
            <br /> <br />
            my regular day shift had got cancelled and the only opening they had
            was for night shift on the floor I normally avoided.
            <br /> <br />I decided I would pick that shift up anyway. And on
            that same day NOVEMBER 16, 2018 I met the love of my life, my
            husband, Aroun.
